# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
Here I present my solution to the famous Titanic machine learning competition.

* Performed the exploratory data analysis
* Performed data cleaning
* Engineered features from the existing variables
* Tested the data on Logistic, Support Vector, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest Regressors to reach the best accuracy score

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.7
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn
**Data set:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

## EDA
I checked how complete the training data set was, and taking into account the missing data I pooled up some valuable information. Below are a few highlights:
